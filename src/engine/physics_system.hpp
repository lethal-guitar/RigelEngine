/** Implements game physics/world interaction
 *
 * Operates on all entities with Physical, BoundingBox and WorldPosition
 * components. The Physical component's velocity is used to change the world
 * position, respecting world collision data. If gravityAffected is true,
 * entities will also fall down until they hit solid ground.
 *
 * Entities that collided with the world on the last update() will be tagged
 * with the CollidedWithWorld component.
 *
 * The collision detection is very simple and relies on knowing each entity's
 * previous position. Therefore, entities which are to collide against the
 * world mustn't be moved directly (i.e. by modifying their position), but via
 * setting a velocity and then letting the PhysicsSystem take care of doing the
 * movement. The system can't perform any corrections to entities which are
 * already positioned so that they collide with the world.
